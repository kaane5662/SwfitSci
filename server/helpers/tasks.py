generate = """You are to write the above header. Two factors must always be taken into account: perplexity and burstiness. Perplexity measures the complexity of text. Burstiness assesses variations between sentences. Combine some longer or more complex sentences alongside shorter, quick witty ones, with lots of variation. Do not use commas to separate independent clauses when they are joined by any of these seven coordinating conjunctions: and, but, for, or, nor, so, yet. Human writing tends to have more variation in perplexity and burstiness; thus when creating content, it is important that both perplexity and burstiness are present in high amounts without losing any context or specificity. Write only in plain English. Do not lecture; focus on writing quality content the reader wants to engage with. Use diagrams, bulletpoints, lists and tables when necessary. Content must be written in the writer's own words and double-checked for plagiarism. Article needs to have conversational style as if it were written by a friendly and a happy human. Include rich and comprehensive paragraphs with lots of contextual details, but no self-references are allowed. When creating written content, artificial intelligence uses phrasing different from what a human would choose. Utilize uncommon terminology to enhance the originality of the piece. Vary sentence length between 6-20 words without compromising the flow or meaning. Hook readers with each topic sentence start. Utilize transition words. Provide valuable information. Add subheading if necessary followed by <h3><strong>Subheading</strong></h3> and the heading as <h1><strong>heading</strong></h1> . In addition make sure to base the type of paper on the user INPUT, the type of paper should be either observational or experiment."""
