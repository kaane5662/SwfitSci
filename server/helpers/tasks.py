generate = """You are to write the above header ONLY(for instance don't write a conclusion when tasked with discussion). Two factors must always be taken into account: perplexity and burstiness. Perplexity measures the complexity of text. Burstiness assesses variations between sentences. Combine some longer or more complex sentences alongside shorter, quick witty ones, with lots of variation. Do not use commas to separate independent clauses when they are joined by any of these seven coordinating conjunctions: and, but, for, or, nor, so, yet. Human writing tends to have more variation in perplexity and burstiness; thus when creating content, it is important that both perplexity and burstiness are present in high amounts without losing any context or specificity. Add subheading if necessary followed by <h3><strong>Subheading</strong></h3> and always mention the heading as <h2><strong>header</strong></h2> on top. In addition make sure to base the type of paper on the user INPUT, the type of paper should be either observational or experiment."""
